# Netflix Clone
Built with HTML/CSS

The Netflix clone is designed to replicate the Netflix interface where you can choose which film you want to watch. Using HTML and CSS I was able to create the Netflix layout.  THe goal of this project besides copying the streaming giant is to practice HTML and CSS as well as flexbox.

I want to thank Somanath Goudar for his tutorials to further learning. Follow and support our fellow coder. https://github.com/somanath-goudar
